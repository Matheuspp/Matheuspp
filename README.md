I began programming 7 years ago and started my studies in Computer Science at the Federal University of ViÃ§osa (2018-2022). I graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of UberlÃ¢ndia. My software development career spans over 6 years.

I have worked with clients globally, and I am involved in development at [Vigil Global](https://vigil.global/), a consulting and software company based in London.
